There is now a super-duper Automated FFmpeg installer.
It's written by a clever guy called Sherinmon A, and is supplied under a GPL license.

It installs, ffmpeg, ffmpeg-php, MPlayer, Codecs, Flvtool, Lame, Libogg, Libvorbis, 
Vorbis-tools, Libtheora, FFMPEG, AMR 3gp Encoder and decoder (amrnb,amrwb-), 
Ruby, wmf Lib, faad2, facc, a52dec-0.7.4,  xvid/div decoder, and x264  .

Requirements:
a) You will need to have access to ssh to start these installs
b) Must be a Linux/Unix/POSIX server
c) Must need root shell(bash) access
d) Must need 200 MB of free space in your server
	
i) Check if yum in installed or not in the server. If there is no yum, please make 
sure automake,autoconf and libtools are installed. It is reccommend to configure the 
distribution specific  yum.	

There are two types of installers, one for root users and one for users on shared hosts.
The instructions below are as of October 9th, 2008.
The process will take a very long time, in the region of 15-20 minutes so be patient.
